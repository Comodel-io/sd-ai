The rates of change for these stocks are represented by flows, which are calculated based on the rules provided. For each stock, there is at least one inflow (increase) and one outflow (decrease). The equations for the flows directly reflect the percentages or fixed amounts described. To fully represent the causal structure and close feedback loops inherent in system dynamics, I have included relationships showing how stocks influence their dependent flows (as described in the text) and how flows influence the stocks they enter or leave. This latter set of relationships (flow to stock) is fundamental to the definition of a stock and is necessary to show how the rates of change actually alter the levels of the stocks, thereby completing the feedback loops.",
