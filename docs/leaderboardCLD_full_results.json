It showed that Americans would not tolerate tyranny and taxation. \nThe Intolerable Acts\nThe British government passed harsh laws that the colonists called the Intolerable Acts. One of the acts closed the port of Boston until the colonists paid for the tea they had ruined. \nThe French and Indian War\nThe British wanted the colonies to repay them for their defense during the French and Indian War (1754–63). \nColonial identity\nThe colonists developed a stronger sense of American identity"

The colonists were angry because they had no representatives in Parliament. \nThe Boston Massacre\nIn 1770, British soldiers fired on a crowd of colonists in Boston, killing five people. The massacre intensified anti-British sentiment and became a propaganda tool for the colonists. \nThe Boston Tea Party\nThe Boston Tea Party was a major act of defiance against British rule. It showed that Americans would not tolerate tyranny and taxation. \nThe Intolerable Acts\nThe British government passed harsh laws that the colonists called the Intolerable Acts. One of the acts closed the port of Boston until the colonists paid for the tea they had ruined. \nThe French and Indian War\nThe British wanted the colonies to repay them for their defense during the French and Indian War (1754–63). \nColonial identity\nThe colonists developed a stronger sense of American identity"

The massacre intensified anti-British sentiment and became a propaganda tool for the colonists. \nThe Boston Tea Party\nThe Boston Tea Party was a major act of defiance against British rule. It showed that Americans would not tolerate tyranny and taxation. \nThe Intolerable Acts\nThe British government passed harsh laws that the colonists called the Intolerable Acts. One of the acts closed the port of Boston until the colonists paid for the tea they had ruined. \nThe French and Indian War\nThe British wanted the colonies to repay them for their defense during the French and Indian War (1754–63). \nColonial identity\nThe colonists developed a stronger sense of American identity"

The colonists were angry because they had no representatives in Parliament. \nThe Boston Massacre\nIn 1770, British soldiers fired on a crowd of colonists in Boston, killing five people. The massacre intensified anti-British sentiment and became a propaganda tool for the colonists. \nThe Boston Tea Party\nThe Boston Tea Party was a major act of defiance against British rule. It showed that Americans would not tolerate tyranny and taxation. \nThe Intolerable Acts\nThe British government passed harsh laws that the colonists called the Intolerable Acts. One of the acts closed the port of Boston until the colonists paid for the tea they had ruined. \nThe French and Indian War\nThe British wanted the colonies to repay them for their defense during the French and Indian War (1754–63). \nColonial identity\nThe colonists developed a stronger sense of American identity"

The massacre intensified anti-British sentiment and became a propaganda tool for the colonists. \nThe Boston Tea Party\nThe Boston Tea Party was a major act of defiance against British rule. It showed that Americans would not tolerate tyranny and taxation. \nThe Intolerable Acts\nThe British government passed harsh laws that the colonists called the Intolerable Acts. One of the acts closed the port of Boston until the colonists paid for the tea they had ruined. \nThe French and Indian War\nThe British wanted the colonies to repay them for their defense during the French and Indian War (1754–63). \nColonial identity\nThe colonists developed a stronger sense of American identity"

The colonists were angry because they had no representatives in Parliament. \nThe Boston Massacre\nIn 1770, British soldiers fired on a crowd of colonists in Boston, killing five people. The massacre intensified anti-British sentiment and became a propaganda tool for the colonists. \nThe Boston Tea Party\nThe Boston Tea Party was a major act of defiance against British rule. It showed that Americans would not tolerate tyranny and taxation. \nThe Intolerable Acts\nThe British government passed harsh laws that the colonists called the Intolerable Acts. One of the acts closed the port of Boston until the colonists paid for the tea they had ruined. \nThe French and Indian War\nThe British wanted the colonies to repay them for their defense during the French and Indian War (1754–63). \nColonial identity\nThe colonists developed a stronger sense of American identity"

The massacre intensified anti-British sentiment and became a propaganda tool for the colonists. \nThe Boston Tea Party\nThe Boston Tea Party was a major act of defiance against British rule. It showed that Americans would not tolerate tyranny and taxation. \nThe Intolerable Acts\nThe British government passed harsh laws that the colonists called the Intolerable Acts. One of the acts closed the port of Boston until the colonists paid for the tea they had ruined. \nThe French and Indian War\nThe British wanted the colonies to repay them for their defense during the French and Indian War (1754–63). \nColonial identity\nThe colonists developed a stronger sense of American identity"

It showed that Americans would not tolerate tyranny and taxation. \nThe Intolerable Acts\nThe British government passed harsh laws that the colonists called the Intolerable Acts. One of the acts closed the port of Boston until the colonists paid for the tea they had ruined. \nThe French and Indian War\nThe British wanted the colonies to repay them for their defense during the French and Indian War (1754–63). \nColonial identity\nThe colonists developed a stronger sense of American identity"

The massacre intensified anti-British sentiment and became a propaganda tool for the colonists. \nThe Boston Tea Party\nThe Boston Tea Party was a major act of defiance against British rule. It showed that Americans would not tolerate tyranny and taxation. \nThe Intolerable Acts\nThe British government passed harsh laws that the colonists called the Intolerable Acts. One of the acts closed the port of Boston until the colonists paid for the tea they had ruined. \nThe French and Indian War\nThe British wanted the colonies to repay them for their defense during the French and Indian War (1754–63). \nColonial identity\nThe colonists developed a stronger sense of American identity"

The colonists were angry because they had no representatives in Parliament. \nThe Boston Massacre\nIn 1770, British soldiers fired on a crowd of colonists in Boston, killing five people. The massacre intensified anti-British sentiment and became a propaganda tool for the colonists. \nThe Boston Tea Party\nThe Boston Tea Party was a major act of defiance against British rule. It showed that Americans would not tolerate tyranny and taxation. \nThe Intolerable Acts\nThe British government passed harsh laws that the colonists called the Intolerable Acts. One of the acts closed the port of Boston until the colonists paid for the tea they had ruined. \nThe French and Indian War\nThe British wanted the colonies to repay them for their defense during the French and Indian War (1754–63). \nColonial identity\nThe colonists developed a stronger sense of American identity"

The colonists were angry because they had no representatives in Parliament. \nThe Boston Massacre\nIn 1770, British soldiers fired on a crowd of colonists in Boston, killing five people. The massacre intensified anti-British sentiment and became a propaganda tool for the colonists. \nThe Boston Tea Party\nThe Boston Tea Party was a major act of defiance against British rule. It showed that Americans would not tolerate tyranny and taxation. \nThe Intolerable Acts\nThe British government passed harsh laws that the colonists called the Intolerable Acts. One of the acts closed the port of Boston until the colonists paid for the tea they had ruined. \nThe French and Indian War\nThe British wanted the colonies to repay them for their defense during the French and Indian War (1754–63). \nColonial identity\nThe colonists developed a stronger sense of American identity"

The massacre intensified anti-British sentiment and became a propaganda tool for the colonists. \nThe Boston Tea Party\nThe Boston Tea Party was a major act of defiance against British rule. It showed that Americans would not tolerate tyranny and taxation. \nThe Intolerable Acts\nThe British government passed harsh laws that the colonists called the Intolerable Acts. One of the acts closed the port of Boston until the colonists paid for the tea they had ruined. \nThe French and Indian War\nThe British wanted the colonies to repay them for their defense during the French and Indian War (1754–63). \nColonial identity\nThe colonists developed a stronger sense of American identity"

The colonists were angry because they had no representatives in Parliament. \nThe Boston Massacre\nIn 1770, British soldiers fired on a crowd of colonists in Boston, killing five people. The massacre intensified anti-British sentiment and became a propaganda tool for the colonists. \nThe Boston Tea Party\nThe Boston Tea Party was a major act of defiance against British rule. It showed that Americans would not tolerate tyranny and taxation. \nThe Intolerable Acts\nThe British government passed harsh laws that the colonists called the Intolerable Acts. One of the acts closed the port of Boston until the colonists paid for the tea they had ruined. \nThe French and Indian War\nThe British wanted the colonies to repay them for their defense during the French and Indian War (1754–63). \nColonial identity\nThe colonists developed a stronger sense of American identity"

The colonists were angry because they had no representatives in Parliament. \nThe Boston Massacre\nIn 1770, British soldiers fired on a crowd of colonists in Boston, killing five people. The massacre intensified anti-British sentiment and became a propaganda tool for the colonists. \nThe Boston Tea Party\nThe Boston Tea Party was a major act of defiance against British rule. It showed that Americans would not tolerate tyranny and taxation. \nThe Intolerable Acts\nThe British government passed harsh laws that the colonists called the Intolerable Acts. One of the acts closed the port of Boston until the colonists paid for the tea they had ruined. \nThe French and Indian War\nThe British wanted the colonies to repay them for their defense during the French and Indian War (1754–63). \nColonial identity\nThe colonists developed a stronger sense of American identity"

The massacre intensified anti-British sentiment and became a propaganda tool for the colonists. \nThe Boston Tea Party\nThe Boston Tea Party was a major act of defiance against British rule. It showed that Americans would not tolerate tyranny and taxation. \nThe Intolerable Acts\nThe British government passed harsh laws that the colonists called the Intolerable Acts. One of the acts closed the port of Boston until the colonists paid for the tea they had ruined. \nThe French and Indian War\nThe British wanted the colonies to repay them for their defense during the French and Indian War (1754–63). \nColonial identity\nThe colonists developed a stronger sense of American identity"

The colonists were angry because they had no representatives in Parliament. \nThe Boston Massacre\nIn 1770, British soldiers fired on a crowd of colonists in Boston, killing five people. The massacre intensified anti-British sentiment and became a propaganda tool for the colonists. \nThe Boston Tea Party\nThe Boston Tea Party was a major act of defiance against British rule. It showed that Americans would not tolerate tyranny and taxation. \nThe Intolerable Acts\nThe British government passed harsh laws that the colonists called the Intolerable Acts. One of the acts closed the port of Boston until the colonists paid for the tea they had ruined. \nThe French and Indian War\nThe British wanted the colonies to repay them for their defense during the French and Indian War (1754–63). \nColonial identity\nThe colonists developed a stronger sense of American identity"

It showed that Americans would not tolerate tyranny and taxation. \nThe Intolerable Acts\nThe British government passed harsh laws that the colonists called the Intolerable Acts. One of the acts closed the port of Boston until the colonists paid for the tea they had ruined. \nThe French and Indian War\nThe British wanted the colonies to repay them for their defense during the French and Indian War (1754–63). \nColonial identity\nThe colonists developed a stronger sense of American identity"

The colonists were angry because they had no representatives in Parliament. \nThe Boston Massacre\nIn 1770, British soldiers fired on a crowd of colonists in Boston, killing five people. The massacre intensified anti-British sentiment and became a propaganda tool for the colonists. \nThe Boston Tea Party\nThe Boston Tea Party was a major act of defiance against British rule. It showed that Americans would not tolerate tyranny and taxation. \nThe Intolerable Acts\nThe British government passed harsh laws that the colonists called the Intolerable Acts. One of the acts closed the port of Boston until the colonists paid for the tea they had ruined. \nThe French and Indian War\nThe British wanted the colonies to repay them for their defense during the French and Indian War (1754–63). \nColonial identity\nThe colonists developed a stronger sense of American identity"

The colonists were angry because they had no representatives in Parliament. \nThe Boston Massacre\nIn 1770, British soldiers fired on a crowd of colonists in Boston, killing five people. The massacre intensified anti-British sentiment and became a propaganda tool for the colonists. \nThe Boston Tea Party\nThe Boston Tea Party was a major act of defiance against British rule. It showed that Americans would not tolerate tyranny and taxation. \nThe Intolerable Acts\nThe British government passed harsh laws that the colonists called the Intolerable Acts. One of the acts closed the port of Boston until the colonists paid for the tea they had ruined. \nThe French and Indian War\nThe British wanted the colonies to repay them for their defense during the French and Indian War (1754–63). \nColonial identity\nThe colonists developed a stronger sense of American identity"

The massacre intensified anti-British sentiment and became a propaganda tool for the colonists. \nThe Boston Tea Party\nThe Boston Tea Party was a major act of defiance against British rule. It showed that Americans would not tolerate tyranny and taxation. \nThe Intolerable Acts\nThe British government passed harsh laws that the colonists called the Intolerable Acts. One of the acts closed the port of Boston until the colonists paid for the tea they had ruined. \nThe French and Indian War\nThe British wanted the colonies to repay them for their defense during the French and Indian War (1754–63). \nColonial identity\nThe colonists developed a stronger sense of American identity"

It showed that Americans would not tolerate tyranny and taxation. \nThe Intolerable Acts\nThe British government passed harsh laws that the colonists called the Intolerable Acts. One of the acts closed the port of Boston until the colonists paid for the tea they had ruined. \nThe French and Indian War\nThe British wanted the colonies to repay them for their defense during the French and Indian War (1754–63). \nColonial identity\nThe colonists developed a stronger sense of American identity"

The colonists were angry because they had no representatives in Parliament. \nThe Boston Massacre\nIn 1770, British soldiers fired on a crowd of colonists in Boston, killing five people. The massacre intensified anti-British sentiment and became a propaganda tool for the colonists. \nThe Boston Tea Party\nThe Boston Tea Party was a major act of defiance against British rule. It showed that Americans would not tolerate tyranny and taxation. \nThe Intolerable Acts\nThe British government passed harsh laws that the colonists called the Intolerable Acts. One of the acts closed the port of Boston until the colonists paid for the tea they had ruined. \nThe French and Indian War\nThe British wanted the colonies to repay them for their defense during the French and Indian War (1754–63). \nColonial identity\nThe colonists developed a stronger sense of American identity"

One of the acts closed the port of Boston until the colonists paid for the tea they had ruined. \nThe French and Indian War\nThe British wanted the colonies to repay them for their defense during the French and Indian War (1754–63). \nColonial identity\nThe colonists developed a stronger sense of American identity"

It showed that Americans would not tolerate tyranny and taxation. \nThe Intolerable Acts\nThe British government passed harsh laws that the colonists called the Intolerable Acts. One of the acts closed the port of Boston until the colonists paid for the tea they had ruined. \nThe French and Indian War\nThe British wanted the colonies to repay them for their defense during the French and Indian War (1754–63). \nColonial identity\nThe colonists developed a stronger sense of American identity"

One of the acts closed the port of Boston until the colonists paid for the tea they had ruined. \nThe French and Indian War\nThe British wanted the colonies to repay them for their defense during the French and Indian War (1754–63). \nColonial identity\nThe colonists developed a stronger sense of American identity"

The massacre intensified anti-British sentiment and became a propaganda tool for the colonists. \nThe Boston Tea Party\nThe Boston Tea Party was a major act of defiance against British rule. It showed that Americans would not tolerate tyranny and taxation. \nThe Intolerable Acts\nThe British government passed harsh laws that the colonists called the Intolerable Acts. One of the acts closed the port of Boston until the colonists paid for the tea they had ruined. \nThe French and Indian War\nThe British wanted the colonies to repay them for their defense during the French and Indian War (1754–63). \nColonial identity\nThe colonists developed a stronger sense of American identity"

The colonists were angry because they had no representatives in Parliament. \nThe Boston Massacre\nIn 1770, British soldiers fired on a crowd of colonists in Boston, killing five people. The massacre intensified anti-British sentiment and became a propaganda tool for the colonists. \nThe Boston Tea Party\nThe Boston Tea Party was a major act of defiance against British rule. It showed that Americans would not tolerate tyranny and taxation. \nThe Intolerable Acts\nThe British government passed harsh laws that the colonists called the Intolerable Acts. One of the acts closed the port of Boston until the colonists paid for the tea they had ruined. \nThe French and Indian War\nThe British wanted the colonies to repay them for their defense during the French and Indian War (1754–63). \nColonial identity\nThe colonists developed a stronger sense of American identity"

The colonists were angry because they had no representatives in Parliament. \nThe Boston Massacre\nIn 1770, British soldiers fired on a crowd of colonists in Boston, killing five people. The massacre intensified anti-British sentiment and became a propaganda tool for the colonists. \nThe Boston Tea Party\nThe Boston Tea Party was a major act of defiance against British rule. It showed that Americans would not tolerate tyranny and taxation. \nThe Intolerable Acts\nThe British government passed harsh laws that the colonists called the Intolerable Acts. One of the acts closed the port of Boston until the colonists paid for the tea they had ruined. \nThe French and Indian War\nThe British wanted the colonies to repay them for their defense during the French and Indian War (1754–63). \nColonial identity\nThe colonists developed a stronger sense of American identity"

The colonists were angry because they had no representatives in Parliament. \nThe Boston Massacre\nIn 1770, British soldiers fired on a crowd of colonists in Boston, killing five people. The massacre intensified anti-British sentiment and became a propaganda tool for the colonists. \nThe Boston Tea Party\nThe Boston Tea Party was a major act of defiance against British rule. It showed that Americans would not tolerate tyranny and taxation. \nThe Intolerable Acts\nThe British government passed harsh laws that the colonists called the Intolerable Acts. One of the acts closed the port of Boston until the colonists paid for the tea they had ruined. \nThe French and Indian War\nThe British wanted the colonies to repay them for their defense during the French and Indian War (1754–63). \nColonial identity\nThe colonists developed a stronger sense of American identity"

The colonists were angry because they had no representatives in Parliament. \nThe Boston Massacre\nIn 1770, British soldiers fired on a crowd of colonists in Boston, killing five people. The massacre intensified anti-British sentiment and became a propaganda tool for the colonists. \nThe Boston Tea Party\nThe Boston Tea Party was a major act of defiance against British rule. It showed that Americans would not tolerate tyranny and taxation. \nThe Intolerable Acts\nThe British government passed harsh laws that the colonists called the Intolerable Acts. One of the acts closed the port of Boston until the colonists paid for the tea they had ruined. \nThe French and Indian War\nThe British wanted the colonies to repay them for their defense during the French and Indian War (1754–63). \nColonial identity\nThe colonists developed a stronger sense of American identity"

The massacre intensified anti-British sentiment and became a propaganda tool for the colonists. \nThe Boston Tea Party\nThe Boston Tea Party was a major act of defiance against British rule. It showed that Americans would not tolerate tyranny and taxation. \nThe Intolerable Acts\nThe British government passed harsh laws that the colonists called the Intolerable Acts. One of the acts closed the port of Boston until the colonists paid for the tea they had ruined. \nThe French and Indian War\nThe British wanted the colonies to repay them for their defense during the French and Indian War (1754–63). \nColonial identity\nThe colonists developed a stronger sense of American identity"

The colonists were angry because they had no representatives in Parliament. \nThe Boston Massacre\nIn 1770, British soldiers fired on a crowd of colonists in Boston, killing five people. The massacre intensified anti-British sentiment and became a propaganda tool for the colonists. \nThe Boston Tea Party\nThe Boston Tea Party was a major act of defiance against British rule. It showed that Americans would not tolerate tyranny and taxation. \nThe Intolerable Acts\nThe British government passed harsh laws that the colonists called the Intolerable Acts. One of the acts closed the port of Boston until the colonists paid for the tea they had ruined. \nThe French and Indian War\nThe British wanted the colonies to repay them for their defense during the French and Indian War (1754–63). \nColonial identity\nThe colonists developed a stronger sense of American identity"

The colonists were angry because they had no representatives in Parliament. \nThe Boston Massacre\nIn 1770, British soldiers fired on a crowd of colonists in Boston, killing five people. The massacre intensified anti-British sentiment and became a propaganda tool for the colonists. \nThe Boston Tea Party\nThe Boston Tea Party was a major act of defiance against British rule. It showed that Americans would not tolerate tyranny and taxation. \nThe Intolerable Acts\nThe British government passed harsh laws that the colonists called the Intolerable Acts. One of the acts closed the port of Boston until the colonists paid for the tea they had ruined. \nThe French and Indian War\nThe British wanted the colonies to repay them for their defense during the French and Indian War (1754–63). \nColonial identity\nThe colonists developed a stronger sense of American identity"

The massacre intensified anti-British sentiment and became a propaganda tool for the colonists. \nThe Boston Tea Party\nThe Boston Tea Party was a major act of defiance against British rule. It showed that Americans would not tolerate tyranny and taxation. \nThe Intolerable Acts\nThe British government passed harsh laws that the colonists called the Intolerable Acts. One of the acts closed the port of Boston until the colonists paid for the tea they had ruined. \nThe French and Indian War\nThe British wanted the colonies to repay them for their defense during the French and Indian War (1754–63). \nColonial identity\nThe colonists developed a stronger sense of American identity"

The colonists were angry because they had no representatives in Parliament. \nThe Boston Massacre\nIn 1770, British soldiers fired on a crowd of colonists in Boston, killing five people. The massacre intensified anti-British sentiment and became a propaganda tool for the colonists. \nThe Boston Tea Party\nThe Boston Tea Party was a major act of defiance against British rule. It showed that Americans would not tolerate tyranny and taxation. \nThe Intolerable Acts\nThe British government passed harsh laws that the colonists called the Intolerable Acts. One of the acts closed the port of Boston until the colonists paid for the tea they had ruined. \nThe French and Indian War\nThe British wanted the colonies to repay them for their defense during the French and Indian War (1754–63). \nColonial identity\nThe colonists developed a stronger sense of American identity"

The colonists were angry because they had no representatives in Parliament. \nThe Boston Massacre\nIn 1770, British soldiers fired on a crowd of colonists in Boston, killing five people. The massacre intensified anti-British sentiment and became a propaganda tool for the colonists. \nThe Boston Tea Party\nThe Boston Tea Party was a major act of defiance against British rule. It showed that Americans would not tolerate tyranny and taxation. \nThe Intolerable Acts\nThe British government passed harsh laws that the colonists called the Intolerable Acts. One of the acts closed the port of Boston until the colonists paid for the tea they had ruined. \nThe French and Indian War\nThe British wanted the colonies to repay them for their defense during the French and Indian War (1754–63). \nColonial identity\nThe colonists developed a stronger sense of American identity"

The colonists were angry because they had no representatives in Parliament. \nThe Boston Massacre\nIn 1770, British soldiers fired on a crowd of colonists in Boston, killing five people. The massacre intensified anti-British sentiment and became a propaganda tool for the colonists. \nThe Boston Tea Party\nThe Boston Tea Party was a major act of defiance against British rule. It showed that Americans would not tolerate tyranny and taxation. \nThe Intolerable Acts\nThe British government passed harsh laws that the colonists called the Intolerable Acts. One of the acts closed the port of Boston until the colonists paid for the tea they had ruined. \nThe French and Indian War\nThe British wanted the colonies to repay them for their defense during the French and Indian War (1754–63). \nColonial identity\nThe colonists developed a stronger sense of American identity"

The colonists were angry because they had no representatives in Parliament. \nThe Boston Massacre\nIn 1770, British soldiers fired on a crowd of colonists in Boston, killing five people. The massacre intensified anti-British sentiment and became a propaganda tool for the colonists. \nThe Boston Tea Party\nThe Boston Tea Party was a major act of defiance against British rule. It showed that Americans would not tolerate tyranny and taxation. \nThe Intolerable Acts\nThe British government passed harsh laws that the colonists called the Intolerable Acts. One of the acts closed the port of Boston until the colonists paid for the tea they had ruined. \nThe French and Indian War\nThe British wanted the colonies to repay them for their defense during the French and Indian War (1754–63). \nColonial identity\nThe colonists developed a stronger sense of American identity"

The colonists were angry because they had no representatives in Parliament. \nThe Boston Massacre\nIn 1770, British soldiers fired on a crowd of colonists in Boston, killing five people. The massacre intensified anti-British sentiment and became a propaganda tool for the colonists. \nThe Boston Tea Party\nThe Boston Tea Party was a major act of defiance against British rule. It showed that Americans would not tolerate tyranny and taxation. \nThe Intolerable Acts\nThe British government passed harsh laws that the colonists called the Intolerable Acts. One of the acts closed the port of Boston until the colonists paid for the tea they had ruined. \nThe French and Indian War\nThe British wanted the colonies to repay them for their defense during the French and Indian War (1754–63). \nColonial identity\nThe colonists developed a stronger sense of American identity"

The colonists were angry because they had no representatives in Parliament. \nThe Boston Massacre\nIn 1770, British soldiers fired on a crowd of colonists in Boston, killing five people. The massacre intensified anti-British sentiment and became a propaganda tool for the colonists. \nThe Boston Tea Party\nThe Boston Tea Party was a major act of defiance against British rule. It showed that Americans would not tolerate tyranny and taxation. \nThe Intolerable Acts\nThe British government passed harsh laws that the colonists called the Intolerable Acts. One of the acts closed the port of Boston until the colonists paid for the tea they had ruined. \nThe French and Indian War\nThe British wanted the colonies to repay them for their defense during the French and Indian War (1754–63). \nColonial identity\nThe colonists developed a stronger sense of American identity"

The colonists were angry because they had no representatives in Parliament. \nThe Boston Massacre\nIn 1770, British soldiers fired on a crowd of colonists in Boston, killing five people. The massacre intensified anti-British sentiment and became a propaganda tool for the colonists. \nThe Boston Tea Party\nThe Boston Tea Party was a major act of defiance against British rule. It showed that Americans would not tolerate tyranny and taxation. \nThe Intolerable Acts\nThe British government passed harsh laws that the colonists called the Intolerable Acts. One of the acts closed the port of Boston until the colonists paid for the tea they had ruined. \nThe French and Indian War\nThe British wanted the colonies to repay them for their defense during the French and Indian War (1754–63). \nColonial identity\nThe colonists developed a stronger sense of American identity"

The massacre intensified anti-British sentiment and became a propaganda tool for the colonists. \nThe Boston Tea Party\nThe Boston Tea Party was a major act of defiance against British rule. It showed that Americans would not tolerate tyranny and taxation. \nThe Intolerable Acts\nThe British government passed harsh laws that the colonists called the Intolerable Acts. One of the acts closed the port of Boston until the colonists paid for the tea they had ruined. \nThe French and Indian War\nThe British wanted the colonies to repay them for their defense during the French and Indian War (1754–63). \nColonial identity\nThe colonists developed a stronger sense of American identity"

The colonists were angry because they had no representatives in Parliament. \nThe Boston Massacre\nIn 1770, British soldiers fired on a crowd of colonists in Boston, killing five people. The massacre intensified anti-British sentiment and became a propaganda tool for the colonists. \nThe Boston Tea Party\nThe Boston Tea Party was a major act of defiance against British rule. It showed that Americans would not tolerate tyranny and taxation. \nThe Intolerable Acts\nThe British government passed harsh laws that the colonists called the Intolerable Acts. One of the acts closed the port of Boston until the colonists paid for the tea they had ruined. \nThe French and Indian War\nThe British wanted the colonies to repay them for their defense during the French and Indian War (1754–63). \nColonial identity\nThe colonists developed a stronger sense of American identity"

One of the acts closed the port of Boston until the colonists paid for the tea they had ruined. \nThe French and Indian War\nThe British wanted the colonies to repay them for their defense during the French and Indian War (1754–63). \nColonial identity\nThe colonists developed a stronger sense of American identity"

The massacre intensified anti-British sentiment and became a propaganda tool for the colonists. \nThe Boston Tea Party\nThe Boston Tea Party was a major act of defiance against British rule. It showed that Americans would not tolerate tyranny and taxation. \nThe Intolerable Acts\nThe British government passed harsh laws that the colonists called the Intolerable Acts. One of the acts closed the port of Boston until the colonists paid for the tea they had ruined. \nThe French and Indian War\nThe British wanted the colonies to repay them for their defense during the French and Indian War (1754–63). \nColonial identity\nThe colonists developed a stronger sense of American identity"

The colonists were angry because they had no representatives in Parliament. \nThe Boston Massacre\nIn 1770, British soldiers fired on a crowd of colonists in Boston, killing five people. The massacre intensified anti-British sentiment and became a propaganda tool for the colonists. \nThe Boston Tea Party\nThe Boston Tea Party was a major act of defiance against British rule. It showed that Americans would not tolerate tyranny and taxation. \nThe Intolerable Acts\nThe British government passed harsh laws that the colonists called the Intolerable Acts. One of the acts closed the port of Boston until the colonists paid for the tea they had ruined. \nThe French and Indian War\nThe British wanted the colonies to repay them for their defense during the French and Indian War (1754–63). \nColonial identity\nThe colonists developed a stronger sense of American identity"

The colonists were angry because they had no representatives in Parliament. \nThe Boston Massacre\nIn 1770, British soldiers fired on a crowd of colonists in Boston, killing five people. The massacre intensified anti-British sentiment and became a propaganda tool for the colonists. \nThe Boston Tea Party\nThe Boston Tea Party was a major act of defiance against British rule. It showed that Americans would not tolerate tyranny and taxation. \nThe Intolerable Acts\nThe British government passed harsh laws that the colonists called the Intolerable Acts. One of the acts closed the port of Boston until the colonists paid for the tea they had ruined. \nThe French and Indian War\nThe British wanted the colonies to repay them for their defense during the French and Indian War (1754–63). \nColonial identity\nThe colonists developed a stronger sense of American identity"

The colonists were angry because they had no representatives in Parliament. \nThe Boston Massacre\nIn 1770, British soldiers fired on a crowd of colonists in Boston, killing five people. The massacre intensified anti-British sentiment and became a propaganda tool for the colonists. \nThe Boston Tea Party\nThe Boston Tea Party was a major act of defiance against British rule. It showed that Americans would not tolerate tyranny and taxation. \nThe Intolerable Acts\nThe British government passed harsh laws that the colonists called the Intolerable Acts. One of the acts closed the port of Boston until the colonists paid for the tea they had ruined. \nThe French and Indian War\nThe British wanted the colonies to repay them for their defense during the French and Indian War (1754–63). \nColonial identity\nThe colonists developed a stronger sense of American identity"
