The American Revolution was caused by a number of factors, including:
Taxation
The British imposed new taxes on the colonies to raise money, such as the Stamp Act of 1765, which taxed legal documents, newspapers, and playing cards. The colonists were angry because they had no representatives in Parliament. 
The Boston Massacre
In 1770, British soldiers fired on a crowd of colonists in Boston, killing five people. The massacre intensified anti-British sentiment and became a propaganda tool for the colonists. 
The Boston Tea Party
The Boston Tea Party was a major act of defiance against British rule. It showed that Americans would not tolerate tyranny and taxation. 
The Intolerable Acts
The British government passed harsh laws that the colonists called the Intolerable Acts. One of the acts closed the port of Boston until the colonists paid for the tea they had ruined. 
The French and Indian War
The British wanted the colonies to repay them for their defense during the French and Indian War (1754â€“63). 
Colonial identity
The colonists developed a stronger sense of American identity
